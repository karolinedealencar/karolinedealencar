I started in technology at the end of 2016 as a web frontend and since 2019 I am exploring the backend world, focusing on nodejs. 
  
I love learning new things and am always looking to improve my hard and soft skills, here on my profile you can find some of my studies and projects, hope u enjoy it =)
